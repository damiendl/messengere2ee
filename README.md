Format FB Messenger end-to-end encrypted chat logs
The attached Powershell code may be used to format Facebook Messenger end-to-end encrypted chat logs JSON raw data into human-readable text.
Limitations:
 - Does not support message reactions (all reactions are discarded)
 - Some characters, especially emojis, may not display properly
 - Unless interest is shown in this project, I have no plan to actively maintain it

The code was found to be working correctly under Desktop Powershell version 5.1 | Build version 10 | CLR version 4

Instruction: simply paste the folder path where all JSON files are contained and execute run the script, a folder will be created at this location for output files
